Shape Class:-A Shape allows you to display vector art in the display list. 
            It composites a Graphics instance which exposes all of the vector drawing methods. 
            The Graphics instance can be shared between multiple Shape instances to display 
             the same vector graphics with different positions or transforms.

ticket:-The Ticker provides a centralized tick or heartbeat broadcast at a set interval. 
      Listeners can subscribe to the tick event to be notified when a set time interval has elapsed.
      Note that the interval that the tick event is called is a target interval, 
       and may be broadcast at a slower interval when under high CPU load. 
       The Ticker class uses a static interface (ex. Ticker.framerate = 30;) and can not be instantiated.

FPS:-Frame Per Second 

Stage Class:-A stage is the root level Container for a display list. 
            Each time its tick method is called, it will render its display list to its target canvas.
